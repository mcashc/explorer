    <h1 class="text-center mb-2">WHAT IS MCASH?</h1>
    <p class="mb-5 p-3" style="font-size: 20px;">
        MCash is a peer-to-peer Internet currency that enables instant, near-zero cost payments to anyone in the world.
         MCash is an open source, global payment network that is fully decentralized without any central authorities. 
         Mathematics secures the network and empowers individuals to control their own finances. 
         MCash features faster transaction confirmation times and improved storage efficiency than the leading math-based currency. 
         With substantial industry support, 
        trade volume and liquidity, MCash is a proven medium of commerce complementary to Bitcoin.

              <p class="card-text">The MCash blockchain is capable of handling higher transaction volume than its counterpart - Bitcoin. Due to more frequent block generation, the network supports more transactions without a need to modify the software in the future.
                As a result, merchants get faster confirmation times, while still having ability to wait for more confirmations when selling bigger ticket items</p>

                This provides protection from wallet-stealing viruses and trojans as well as a sanity check before sending payments.</p>
